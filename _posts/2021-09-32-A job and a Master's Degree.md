title: September 2021 - A job and a Master's Degree
---

# My full-time job
On 20 of September, I started working as a Radiology Technician on Cleerly, in Lisbon.

[Cleerly](https://www2.cleerlyhealth.com/) is a start-up that applies AI algorithms to non-invasive Coronary computed tomography angiograms (CCTA), providing its qualitative analysis and a comprehensive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a matter of minutes. 

I have been learning a lot and I'm very excited to see my value in this company.

# My Master's Degree in Biomedical Engineering
In October, I will begin my classes for my Master's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/) (Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa).

I'm very excited about this. I've been waiting for this for over a month now. Until now, everything I learned about Machine Learning and Deep Learning was all by myself, and even though that will continue, I'm eager to learn more in classes.

# My Deep Lerning Journey
This month I started a project but unfortunately, I had to put it on stand-by. The project is to code a classifier model for X-rays images with and without pneumonia disease. The problem is that I think I'm trying to move faster than I'm capable of at the moment. So, I put this project aside and continued to follow the lessons and chapters of the fastai course.

I've been through problems with tabular data and recommended systems where I used random forests. However, I only scratched their surface. Yes, they are important for me to know, but they are not my priority at the moment. My priorities intercept between images and computer vision, and that's where I'll focus more of my energy and time later on.
