title: November 2021 - Exams and an Arduino Uno
---

This monthly update came out a little bit late, but it's better late than ever so, there it is.

## Exams, exams and some group projects.
The majority of my time outside work was spent studying for exams. It was not that exciting, but I learnt about some really interesting stuff, especially about biosensors. 

This month, I also started some group projects that my colleagues and I need to do. One of them is about cybersecurity in healthcare and it's been quite interesting to learn about this topic as I read more and more papers about it.

## Started working with the Arduino Uno
For my sensors and electronics class, I started working with the Arduino Uno. We've been developing some basic programs to blink LEDs and I have been enjoying it. Since I learnt how to program in python I'm fascinated with programming in general so, learning a new language and seeing the results of it immediately has been satisfying.
