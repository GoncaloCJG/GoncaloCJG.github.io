title: February 2022 - The End of the 1st Semester of my Master's degree
---

That's right, this month ended the 1st semester of my first year of my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering. It was five hard-working months, especially because I was working on my full-time job during the day and studying at night, but in the end, everything paid off. I ended up with grades that I'm proud of and did some good projects that taught me a lot. 

With more free time at the end of the month, I was able to do some interesting stuff. Here are the main takeaways:

## Happywhale competition
For the last months, I couldn't manage to take the time to enter actively in Kaggle competitions, so now I made sure to make that possible: I entered the [Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Indentification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/happy-whale-and-dolphin).

For now, I've been paying more attention to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cleaning data. I know this is a crucial part to get a good predictive model, so I'm taking my time to learn it.
## A great book to read
For some time I wanted to read something of Albert Camus and the time has come. I've been reading ["The Myth of Sisyphus"](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Vintage-International/dp/0525564454) and, although it's a quite hard philosophy book, I've been enjoying it. 

This essay introduces the philosophy of the [absurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) of Camus while trying to attribute meaning to life.
