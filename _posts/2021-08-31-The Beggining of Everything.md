title: The Beggining of Everything

# The beggining of my online portfolio

August was when everything started out. I created this, my online portfolio, and started writing a monthly update to show what I'm working on and how it is going on the given month.

The idea of creating an online portfolio was not new to me. But it was around mid-august when I put it in practice. 

I developed this website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with the theme [dark-poole](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole) by [Andrew Park](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark), and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Even though I was not very familiar with git, GitHub, or even jekyll, it took me only 3 days set up the whole thing by following some tutorials. I was expecting to be more difficult and I'm very satisfied with the result.

# The beggining of my Deep Learning journey 
Before starting with Deep Learning, firstly, I grasped more conventional machine learning models and experimented a little bit with the scikit-learn library. Simultaneously, I followed the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, for some context and explanation of the various algorithms and hyperparameters.

Two weeks went by and I started with Deep Learning. I have been following the [Deep Learning Course](https://course.fast.ai/) by [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) and I'm really enjoying it. The course follows a learning philosophy of starting with "the whole game", where we practice and implement state-of-the-art models, and then we learn the details beneath it. As they say in [this](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/) article: *"Having a big picture understanding gives you more of a framework to place the fundamentals in"*.

For now, I was able to train a model to classify images between 3 species of turtles with 99% accuracy. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/GoncaloCJG/Turtle_Classifier). I tried to deploy it on Binder, but I think due to issues related to the environment it wasn't possible. I never worked on any project with Github, so this environment thing is new to me. Next project I'll give more time to learn it and make sure everything runs smoothly.
