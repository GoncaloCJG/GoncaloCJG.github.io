  <p>Hi, I'm Gon√ßalo! <br>
  <br>
  I'm a Medical Imaging and Radiotherapy Technologist. Currently, I'm working at Cleerly as a Radiology Technologist and about to start my Master's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at ISEL (Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa).<br>
  <br>
  I'm fascinated by new and innovative ways that bring AI and Medicine together. I believe that in the future both worlds can benefit a lot from each other. <br>
  <br>
  I love writing. Monthly, on the last day of the month, I publish a monthly update of the current month to keep myself accountable.<br>
  <br>
